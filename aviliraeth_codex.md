## On the Language Called Avliraeth

> *“To speak Avliraeth is not merely to utter—  
It is to remember the first wind,  
To call it back from the void,  
And to shape it into meaning.”*  
— Archivist Vethil Dran, Circle of the Fifth Whisper

### Origins

**Avliraeth** is a sacred language, believed by mystics and scholars to predate written record. Its very construction embodies the philosophy of voice as creation, memory, and renewal.

- **Avik** — breath, life-wind, essence of voice  
- **-reth** — echo, presence, or intangible thread  
→ *Avreth*: “The echoed breath”

- **Lirav** — to cleanse, to wash, to flow unbroken  
- **-qen** — language, tradition, rooted form  
→ *Liraqen*: “The flowing tongue”

Together, **Avliraeth** becomes:
- “The clear breath”
- “The purifying voice”
- “The tongue that was never corrupted”

### Usage and Dialects

- **Qel Avliraeth**: “The Bound Breath” — used in oaths, coronations, sacred rites  
- **Liraeth**: a softened common form, found among bards, traders, and distant archives

---

### Glyphic Representation

The sigil for *Avliraeth* is drawn as a **rising spiral** with a **broken central ring**, symbolizing:
- Breath that continues after silence
- Echo without origin
- Memory without end

---

### Notes on Preservation

Though many fear it faded, Avliraeth endures in:
- The **Codex of the Singing Root**
- The carved stones of **Darethiin**
- The names of places no longer found on maps

---

> *“When the Ninth Breath was lost in the Depthwood, the glyphs dimmed.  
> Speech became heavier. And so Avliraeth was placed in scrolls, not mouths.”*  
> — Elaron Mirth, Last Keeper of the Bound Sigil
